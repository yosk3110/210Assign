<!--
   This script tests the behaviour of the browser when multiple script tags are used.
   When a language is specified in the first tag, the browser expects the rest of the
   tags to contain that language unless they specify otherwise.  The HTML page can
   contain many tags with different languages as long as they each specify the
   language attribute.
   In this case, the first tag contains VBScript, and when it runs an error occurs on
   the second script tag because the browser is expecting VBScript.  We can
   avoid the error by explicitly delaring the second script tag to contain JavaScript.
-->

   MsgBox "This came from the first script tag"
